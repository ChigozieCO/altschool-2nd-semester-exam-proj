# Provision VMs

To begin this project I need to provision two Ubuntu servers named "Master" and "Slave" using vagrant.

I will be provisioning ubuntu 22.04 LTS for the Master and the slave and I will use a multi-machine environment, this basically means that I will define two VMs in one vagrantfile.

The first this I do is initialize the box, the box I'm using is `ubuntu/jammy64` and because I am using a multi-machine environment I will pass the `-m` (minimal) flag so that the VagrantFile is created without all the comments.

```sh
vagrant init -m ubuntu/jammy64
```

(image 1)

When I open the VagrantFile to edit it, we can see that it has just the basic configuration without all the comments.

```sh
vi VagrantFile
```

(image 2)

To configure my VMs, I will enter the below code into my VagrantFile.

```rb
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

  config.vm.define "master" do |master|
    master.vm.box = "ubuntu/jammy64"
    master.vm.hostname = "master"

    master.vm.network "private_network", type: "dhcp"
    master.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 22, host: 2030, id: "ssh"

    master.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|
      v.name = "Master"
    end
  end

  config.vm.define "slave" do |slave|
    slave.vm.box = "ubuntu/jammy64"
    slave.vm.hostname = "slave"

    slave.vm.network "private_network", type: "dhcp"
    slave.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 22, host: 2032, id: "ssh"

    slave.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|
      v.name = "Slave"
    end
  end

end
```

In the VagrantFile above I simply specified the type of base box with which each VM would be created, I ensure they used a private network and they get their ip address from the dhcp server. I also specified the name and hostname of each VM.

Another thing I did was to hard code the host ssh port so that deal with the ssh clash that will happen from the jump, another reason I did this is so that the port doesn't conflict with other VMs I have on my laptop.

To provision the VMs I ran the command 

```sh
vagrant up
```

From the images below you can see that both my master and slave machines were successfully provisioned.

(image 3 and 4 )

To access it and start working with it I ssh into then by specifying their names, as shown below

```sh
vagrant ssh master
vagrant ssh slave
```
